This project undertakes an in-depth case study of Suffolk County Transit (SCT), driven by my personal experience as a daily commuter impressed by its punctuality and extensive coverage. Given Suffolk County's status as the largest easternmost county in the USA, the project aims to assess SCT's effectiveness in fulfilling its purpose. The comprehensive analysis is divided into three parts: an examination of bus ridership trends from 2013–2016, a review of SCT's performance measures and operational characteristics from 2013–2023, and a detailed bus route analysis including GIS visualization and an assessment of its social demographic impact, particularly concerning poverty areas.

The initial phase, "Bus Ridership Demographics," explores ridership trends and patterns between 2013 and 2016, utilizing data from opendata.suffolk. This involved loading ridership data, creating a 'Date' column for time-series analysis, and calculating 'Total_Ridership' by summing various fare types. Visualizations were generated to show total monthly ridership fluctuations and the overall distribution of ridership by fare type. The second part, "SCT’s Performance Measures and Operational Characteristics," uses data from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to evaluate efficiency, productivity, and fleet health from 2013 to 2023. This involved cleaning numerical data, calculating key performance indicators like 'Operating Expense per Vehicle Revenue Mile', and visualizing these trends along with year-over-year changes in operational metrics and fleet characteristics.

The final and most central part of the project, "SCT Bus Route Analysis, GIS Visualization, and Social Demographic Impact," focuses on linking bus routes to demographic data. This involved integrating bus stops and route shapes from GTFS data with town and hamlet polygons, and census tracts. A crucial step included joining population and poverty attributes from ACS data to census tracts using Python, allowing for choropleth and dot density maps to visualize poverty distribution. Buffer zones around routes were created to illustrate service areas, and demographic overlays were performed to understand the relationship between bus infrastructure and socioeconomic characteristics, notably poverty. Ultimately, the analysis confirmed SCT's effective service coverage in Suffolk County, which is both insightful and reassuring.
